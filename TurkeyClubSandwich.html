<h6>What a turkey club sandwich looks like.</h6>
<p>A turkey club sandwich is typically a sandwich with turkey as the primary ingredient topped with lettuce, bacon, tomatos and a sauce of choice usually mayo.
    There is instances where there are extra ingredients it just depends on the twist you want to put onto it, but today we are going to focus on the standard recipe.
</p>
<h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
<p>Here is a list of the ingredients you will need for this recipe</p>
<ul>
    <li>White Bread (3 slices)</li>
    <li>Mayo</li>
    <li>Tomato </li>
    <li>Lettuce</li>
    <li>Turkey</li>
    <li>Bacon</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Start by cooking your bacon. You can do this ahead of time and then have it in the fridge waiting for you to reheat. Or make it fresh when you want to make your sandwich.
         Just crisp up a few slices and let them cool for a couple minutes while you assemble everything else.    </li>
    <li>Toast your slices of bread </li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of mayo over each slice of toasted bread.</li>
         <li>Place lettuce and tomato on top of one slice of the bread. Then top that with a piece of toasted bread with the mayo side facing down.
        </li>
        <li>Then arrange the slices of bacon and turkey along with a little more lettuce. Top with the final slice of toasted bread, mayo side down.</li>
            <li>Now how you cut the sandwich is up to you. It is often cut into small triangles, but if you want to just slice it down the middle diagonally, no one is going to care. 
                If you have a long toothpick, it is best to press it through the sandwich to help the layers stay together.</li>
