# Odin-Project-Recipes
The goal of this project is to display what i have learned so far through the odin project to create a basic recipe website that has a main index page with links to recipes. It is not supposed to look pretty but it is mainly just used to display the skills i have learned so far with html, and later on make the website look better when i learn css.
